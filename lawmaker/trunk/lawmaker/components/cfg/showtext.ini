Generic config format:

    ["command"]={
                  level=1,
                  file="anyfile.txt",
                  help="help text",
                },
                  
                  
The commas are very important. Also it is important to understand that commands have to 
be specified *without* prefix. (otherwise 2 prefixes are needed in main: !!reg :-P)

Format below:

["HH:MM"]="filename.txt",

Can even be 18:33 if this is your perversion :)
Does not have to be a textfile reachable by command as well. :)
A textfile can be bound to any number of timestamps.
Just comment a line if you do not need it any longer, or rename the file to a non-existant.
Or, delete the file (if a file does not exist, there are gonna be no errors).
