Now something new. With these prefixes, one can not enter the hub.
This one works even if prefix check is off.
Obviously these only affect unreg users, and should only contain the most necessary elements.
(Only unregs can have bad prefix, because a user using a bad prefix cannot be registered IMHO. :P)
