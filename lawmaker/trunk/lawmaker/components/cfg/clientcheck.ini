                               CLIENT CHECKING STUFF
                              =======================
Set the minimum dc++ and mod version, does not apply for oDC and StrongDC.
(I am unsure whether you should allow oDC at all.)
The min. version should be 0.401, you probably agree.
Note that DC++k CDM is 0.251, so immune the user wanting 2 use it.
However, better use DCDM++.
Either way, no scripts can substitute a CDM, so use one.
Oh, almost forgot: immuned users skip all client checks.
